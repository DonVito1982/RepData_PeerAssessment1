## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
stepsDay2 <- read.csv('data/activity.csv')
minuteAverage <- tapply(stepsDay2$steps, stepsDay2$interval, mean, na.rm = T)
minuteAverage <- as.data.frame(minuteAverage)
for (iter in 1:length(stepsDay2$steps)){
  if (is.na(stepsDay2$steps)){
    stepsDay2$steps[iter] <- minuteAverage[iter %% length(minuteAverage)]
  }
}
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
